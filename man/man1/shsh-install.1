.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
shsh install soraxas/dot\-reminder
install 'soraxas/dot\-reminder' as a package
.TP
shsh install soraxas/git\-utils git/tools
install 'soraxas/git\-utils' to a folder within 'git/tools'
.TP
shsh install \-\-ssh <package>
install with ssh protocal (rather than https)
.TP
shsh install <package> \-v FISH_COMPLETIONS=synoservice.fish:forgit.fish
link 'synoservice.fish' and 'forgit.fish' as fish
completion files
.TP
shsh install <package> \-\-hook pre="mv bin/foo bin/bar"
Execute the script "mv bin/foo bin/bar" before `shsh`
performs linking (e.g. this script renames the binary)
.TP
shsh install <package> \-\-hook +x=foobar
add a hook that add executable bits to the file 'foobar',
before linking is performed
.TP
shsh install <package> \-h pre='make all' \-h post='rm \-r build/*'
add a hook that runs 'make all' to build binaries, right
after cloning and before linking is performed. Then,
linking is performed with its usual rules (i.e. all
executable files in root and in bin/). Finally,
\&'rm \-r build/*' is ran to remove leftovers.
.TP
shsh install \-\-plain wsl\-tools/win32yank \-h pre='curl \-sLo out.zip \e
https://<..>/releases/<..>.zip && unzip out.zip' \-h +x=win32yank.exe
